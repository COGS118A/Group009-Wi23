# COGS118A Project - Wine Quality Prediction Model

In this project, we used a [wine dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/wine+quality) to train a model that can help predict the quality of a wine by giving likely scores from wine-tasting experts. The best model is based on a random forest classifier that has a test accuracy of ~70%. The detailed result can be found in 'FinalProjectGroup009-Wi23.ipynb'.
