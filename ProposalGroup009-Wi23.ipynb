    "Wine classification is a system for categorizing wines based on their characteristics, which helps consumers select wines that meet their taste preferences. The data presents wine’s chemicals from physicochemical tests as well as their qualities rated from score 0 to 10. "

    "# Background\n",
    "Wine is an alcohol drink made from grapes by fermentation. Wine is one of the longest processed beverages in human drinking history. From the Romberg & Fredrikson report, total wine sales were $78.4 billion which included domestic and imported wine<a name=\"wine_trend\"></a>[<sup>[1]</sup>](#Liz). Wine is currently the world's largest production, the most popular brewing wine. Nowadays, there is a market that sells poor quality, or counterfeit wines, many businesses profit from the sale of fake wine, some of which ordinary people can't even taste the difference with the real wine. The pandemic increases the opportunity for fraudulent wine due to travel restrictions, shutdowns, and even layoffs throughout industry channels<a name=\"fraud_wine\"></a>[<sup>[2]</sup>](#Lana). To make the customer easier to distinguish the fake wine,  we want to be able to identify the quality of the wine. And different people have different standards for wine.  It is difficult to have a unified standard if it is purely identified by people. By using machine learning, we can easily identify the quality of the wine even if we are not the wine experts. We will have a unified standard to identify the quality of the various chemicals present in wine."

    "# Problem Statement\n",
    "Flavor variations occur due to the presence of different chemicals in different wines and differences in various conditions. Manipulating these variables can result in a wine with a better flavor profile. Variability and noise play an important role when understanding a situation like this is required, and statistical models are very effective at identifying key inputs from seemingly utterly chaotic data. This article details how wine tasting data and powerful modeling techniques provide insight into a set of variables that are important to an experienced group. Therefore, we aimed to study potential influencing factors affecting wine quality through various regression models to determine whether there is a clear correlation between these potential factors and quality changes.\n"
